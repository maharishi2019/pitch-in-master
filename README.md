## Overview
Many senior citizens, people with disabilities and life-threatening diseases are restricted from going outside for their own health. This prevents them from shopping for everyday products such as groceries, drinks, etc. Our application, **Pitch-In**, serves as a solution to this problem by allowing people in the same community to help each other retrieve essential goods. By creating checklists one has the option of asking for certain products and conversly, one may create a commit-list to ensure that you commit to buying and delivering a product. We hope our application will be helpful in aiding people.
